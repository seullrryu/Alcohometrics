# Alcohometrics  

## Overview
Do you sometimes wonder whether your alcohol tolerance improved from the last time you drank? Alcohometrics is a web app that allows you to keep track of how much you drank the day before and whether you got drunk or not. Users can register and login. Once they are logged in, users can see the list of the all drinks they had over the time they started using this web app. From there, users can input the amount of drinks they had after a night out. The app will store their inputted information in the database, and display whether or not you're alcohol tolerance is improving overtime. 
Potentially, this app will also be able to match users with breweries and within a 5 mile radius with similar drink choices within the same month. 
Implemented using **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Passport.js.**
